# Configuration

## Choose AI Provider

During setup (or later via **"Reconfigure"**), you select the bot's "brain".

### Google Gemini (Recommended)

- Requires an API Key from **Google AI Studio**
- Model: `gemini-2.0-flash` (very fast)
- Free (within limits)

### Ollama (Local)

- Requires a running Ollama server in your network
- URL: `http://YOUR-IP:11434/v1`
- API Key: any value  
(must not be empty, e.g., `ollama`)
- Privacy: **100% local**

## Feature Switches (Security)

After installation, a **HAcoBot** device is created.  
There you will find switches (entities) that allow you to specifically revoke rights from the bot.

For more details, see **Feature Switches**.
